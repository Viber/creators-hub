# Viber Bot Messaging API

Welcome to the messaging section of the Viber Bot API documentation! Messaging is a<br/>
critical aspect of any chatbot, and the Viber Bot API provides several options to send<br/>
messages to your users.

## The Welcome Message
One essential feature of the Viber Bot API is the ability to send a welcome message to<br/>
users before they even subscribe to your bot. This message is a great way to introduce<br/>
your bot to potential users and give them a taste of what your bot can do. With this<br/>
feature, you can make a great first impression and entice users to subscribe to your bot.<br/>

## Sending Direct Messages
Once users have subscribed to your bot, you can use the Viber Bot API to send messages<br/>
directly to them. These messages can be personalized based on user data, such as their<br/>
name or location, and can contain text, images, videos, and more. You can also use this<br/>
feature to ask users for feedback or to provide them with updates about your bot's<br/>
features.<br/>

## Sending Broadcast Messages
Another useful feature of the Viber Bot API is the ability to send broadcast messages to<br/>
your entire user base. This feature is perfect for sending out announcements, news<br/>
updates, or promotional offers. With broadcast messages, you can reach a large audience<br/>
with just a few clicks.<br/>
