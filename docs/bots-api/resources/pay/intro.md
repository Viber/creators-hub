## Terms and Conditions

It's important to note that the use of the [Viber Bot Payment API] is subject to<br/>
[Viber's Terms & Policies](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/). This includes various terms and conditions regarding the use of<br/>
[Viber Chatbot Payments Service](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/terms-and-conditions-regarding-viber-chatbot-payments-service/),
[Viber Public Account, Public Chat, Bot, Community, and <br/> VAP Terms & Guidelines](https://www.viber.com/en/terms/public-chat-public-accounts-terms-guidelines/), as well as the [Viber API Terms of Service](https://developers.viber.com/docs/general/api-terms-of-service/).

It's important to read and understand these terms and policies before implementing<br/>
payment functionality in your bot. Viber may update these policies from time to time, so<br/>
it's important to keep up-to-date with any changes that may affect your bot's payment<br/>
functionality.

By following these policies, you can ensure that your bot remains compliant with Viber's<br/>
guidelines and provides a safe and secure payment experience for your users.

## Setting Up Payment Accounts

One important feature of the Payment section is the ability to set up a payment account<br/>
for your bot. This process involves integrating your bot with a payment gateway, which<br/>
allows you to securely process payments from your users. With the Viber Bot API, you can<br/>
connect your bot to three popular payment gateways in Ukraine: [LiqPay](https://www.liqpay.ua/en/registration), 
[Portmone](https://www.portmone.com.ua/b2b_dash/signup#viber), and<br/>
[IPay](https://www.ipay.ua/). Please note that these are the only payment providers currently supported by the<br/>
Viber Bot API, and support for additional payment providers may be added in the future.<br/>

## Sending Payment Requests

Once you have set up your payment account, you can send payment requests to your<br/>
users. This process involves creating a payment request message, which you can send to<br/>
your users via the Viber messaging platform. When your users receive the payment<br/>
request, they can authorize the payment and complete the transaction within the Viber<br/>
app.<br/>
