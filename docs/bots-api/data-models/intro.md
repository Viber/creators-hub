## Introduction

In the Viber bots API, data models are used to define the structure and format of the data<br/>
exchanged between the Viber server and your bot. These models provide a standardized<br/>
way of representing various types of information, such as messages, user profiles, and<br/>
payment information. By following the data models defined in this section, you can ensure that your<br/>
bot communicates with the Viber server in a consistent and predictable manner. This<br/>
section provides detailed descriptions of the available data models, along with examples<br/>
of how to use them in your bot code.

## The Platform Data Models

The platform uses the following data models for communication with your bot:

* [Message](./message) - The message data model is used to represent all types of messages that can be sent to a user.
* [Subscriber](./subscriber) - The subscriber data model is used to represent a user who has subscribed to your bot.
* [Payment Status](./payment-status) - The payment status data model is used to represent the status of a payment transaction.
