# Introduction

[//]: comment "an intro to events module of the bots api"

The **events** section of the bots API is your one-stop resource for all the events supported<br/>
by the platform. In this section, you will find detailed information on each event, including<br/>
its data, trigger conditions, and additional information that can help you make the most of<br/>
these events in your bot implementation.

Whether you are looking for information on user messages, conversation updates, or<br/>
other events, the events section provides a comprehensive overview of everything you<br/>
need to know. Each event page includes a detailed description of the event and its data,<br/>
as well as information on when the event is triggered and any additional details that are<br/>
relevant.

By utilizing the information provided in the events section of the bots API, you can ensure<br/>
that your bot remains up-to-date with the latest changes in the conversation and provides<br/>
users with a seamless, real-time experience.
